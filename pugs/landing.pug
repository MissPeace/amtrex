        h1 Exposing Online Tracking of American Muslims
        p.text
            | This project takes the cue from the recent Muslim ban made by new elected president Donald Trump. We asked ourselves, how can web tracking technologies be used for religious profiling? How can we raise awareness and reduce the social impact posed by the MassiveProfilingBusiness™ in this context?
            br
            | By looking at the trackers present on some of the most used websites by the Muslim community, one could argue that the information gathered by those trackers could be used by the U.S.A government to enforce the ban. These websites then become a sort of registry providers.
        h2 Who could have a registry?

        p(class="quote") Both as a candidate and now as President, Donald Trump has made clear his intent to pursue aggressive policies targeting Muslims, refugees and immigrants under the banner of national security. In his first week in office Trump enacted the patently unlawful travel ban seeking to bar all refugees, and individuals from 7 Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. A second executive order the same week, as well as later accompanying policy memoranda, extended powers to law enforcement and immigration agencies to increase detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants.

            b But perhaps a “Muslim registry” — or list of deportation targets, for that matter — would not necessarily have to involve registration at all. 
            | The past 10 years have witnessed a boom in big data. The sheer scale of data about people,   combined with advances in data mining techniques, mean that hundreds of US companies now possess “super databases” of hundreds of millions of individually-identifiable consumers.

    p.text If an user accesses frequently these pages, or in a specific moment of the year, reaching them from specific online search, or from other contextual websites these are all cases in which an algorithm can assume the user is an active Islamic practitioner.
    p.text These websites are ultimately responsible of the trackers served to their readers. Often they are not aware of which trackers they are including. Go to the section "What to do" to know more.
